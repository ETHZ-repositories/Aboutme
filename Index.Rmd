## Bio

Surya Gupta pursuing his PhD in Environmental Sciences at ETH Zurich. His research focuses on formulating new [pedotransfer functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedotransfer_function) for soil hydraulic properties that include local soil-forming factors such as vegetation and climate information as a surrogate of soil structure.  He evaluates several statistical approaches (linear regression, random forest, and XGboost) to build the PTF using R, linking comprehensive sets of covariates with data on [soil hydraulic properties](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/soil-hydraulic-properties#:~:text=The%20three%20soil%20hydraulic%20properties,conductivity%20and%20water%2Dvapor%20contents.)
